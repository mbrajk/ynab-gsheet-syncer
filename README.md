# ynab-gsheet-syncer
syncs my budget from ynab to a spreadsheet in google drive

initial version of the code, rough mvp that meets my needs but can be used a base to understand how to interact with YNAB and Google sheets.

Google requires that you make a service account and get a .svc file to read in for authentication to google sheets.

Ynab requires that you turn on development and grab and API key from their website.
